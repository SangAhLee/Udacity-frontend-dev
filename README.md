# udacityfrontend (Personal Blog Project)

## Introductions
This is the first project of Udacity 'Front end web developer' Nanodegree program.
Only HTML and CSS were used in the project to build a personal blog web page layout.

I have a plan to update this further to create my professional portfolio website.
